The goal of the assignment is to flood fill cardinal pixels that connect to and match the initial position's value.
The way that I went about this was using recursion to traverse multiple directions and using a temporary variable.
Using multiple if statements, adjacent values were checked to see if they matched the initial position's values. If
they did, then the method would recurse in that next position. Otherwise, nothing would happen. In order to properly
move forward, though, a variable is needed to hold the initial value of the position. That way, the position's value can
be changed into the color value and still compare adjacent positions.

Note that the random array generator will sometimes fail because of the RNG. This would only be if the index is out of
bounds for when the array's column or row length is 0.
