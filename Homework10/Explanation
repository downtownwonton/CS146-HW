The goal of this assignment is to traverse a tree and print all nodes in the tree by level. The way I tackled this was by using a
breadth-first search. In order to accomplish this, I needed to use a helper method to keep track of the levels of the tree and to recursively
add to a list. 

I realized that the homework suggested stacks and queues, but my mind immediately went to recursion. 

In the helper method, I check to see if a node is null. That means we have reached the end of a path and we can terminate. Otherwise, the goal
is to fill the list with sublists containing nodes per level. We do that by checking to see if an array list has been created for a given level.
If not, then we initialize an array list and for every node in that level, they get inserted into the array, before recursively being called on the left and
right child of the left node. This continues until the nodes are null, after which the original method returns the list filled with the list of nodes for each level.
